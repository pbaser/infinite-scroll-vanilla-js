<p>
      In DOM, only 20 li elements are added, and based on user's scroll these 20 elements are updated with data,
      <ol>
        <li>Intersection observer used to detect bottom and top of the page instead of scroll event</li>
        <li>DOM is not heavy, only limited elements</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
